# Lattice Fixed Reward Staking Contract [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](./LICENSE) [![Audit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Audit-Hacken-blue)](https://hacken.io/audits/lattice-gateway/)

## Overview

The Lattice Gateway is introducing a new feature providing staking pools for users to deposit tokens and gather rewards. This functionality also supports projects seeking to leverage the Lattice platform to incentivize users to stake tokens or offer an additional yield to those who have already contributed liquidity to their projects.

For each project interested in this service, the Lattice team will deploy an updated staking smart contract with suitable pool parameters. In collaboration with the respective project teams, the Lattice team will establish the staking pools. Pool parameters will be customized to each project's unique requirements, ensuring a versatile and adaptable solution.

The Lattice Fixed Reward Staking Contract has been developed as a Solidity smart contract that allows users to stake tokens and accumulate rewards over time. This contract is inspired by [SushiSwap's Staking Contract](https://github.com/sushiswap/StakingContract).
